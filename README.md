# Artemis Project 2017

Artemis is a TEL solution I produced for the University of Bristol, disseminated as an <a href="https://github.com/TaimurAhmed/summerProject2017/wiki/OER">Open Educational Resource (OER).</a> 
You can learn more about the underlying rationale and non-development related stuff by

I developed the project to address a particuar <a href="https://github.com/TaimurAhmed/summerProject2017/wiki/About">
    pedagogical rationale
</a>
to solve an issue specific to the UoB. However you're welcome to resuse this project <a href="https://github.com/TaimurAhmed/summerProject2017/wiki/Legal">within the ambit of the relevant Open Source license</a>

I developed the application with the key design criteria of Security, Accessibility and Web Credibility (UI) in mind, using the XAMPP stack.

The project still needs to be polished. Future work i'd reccomend before beta testing deployment would be:
<ul>
    <li>Object Orientation: The project was developed within a deadline and needs a formal overarchign design pattern</li>
    <li>Abstraction and DRY code: Their is repetetive code in here that could be abstracted as per DRY code principles</li>
    <li>Unit Testing: Nothing has been unit tested yet</li>
    <li>ER Model and DB Normalisation: The ER model needs to be formally mapped and candidates for normalisation considered</li>
</ul>
